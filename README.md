# ATS Friendly Resume Maker

This is a python project that can create an **ATS Friendly Resume** with your picture. ATS stands for **Applicant Tracking System**, which is a software that scans and ranks resumes based on keywords and other criteria. An ATS Friendly Resume is a resume that is optimized for passing the ATS screening and getting more interviews.

## Features

- This project uses the **reportlab** library to generate a PDF resume from your data.
- You can customize your resume by adding your own data to a JSON file.
- You can also add your picture to the resume, which is not common in most ATS friendly resume makers.
- The resume template is simple, elegant, and professional.
